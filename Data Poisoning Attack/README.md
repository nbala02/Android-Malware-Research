# Data Poisoning Attack
Data poisoning attack is one type of adversarial example attack against machine learning based malware detection for android system. In the Data Poisoning Attack, the adversary gets access to the training dataset of the learning algorithm and degrades the performance of the system. There are four different attack strategies for model alteration including Label Modification.

For our research we generated a data poisoning attack for testing purposes in order to improve the defense mechanisms of machine learning classifiers. We generated a file called sampleMalwareVectors.csv where we have malware applications in the form of vectors based on the permissions they request from the users. The vector is represented in binary forms: 1 indicating that the malware requests that permission and 0 indicating that the malware does not request that permission. 

After performing the data poisoning attack we generated a mutatedSampleVectors.csv file where the labels: 1 and 0, are flipped at random permissions. This allows a malware application to disguise itself as non-malicious application which is used to confuse the classifer or generate a data poisoning attack. We used this file to help train the classifer to find patterns of mutated malware applications.

NOTE: FOR SECURITY PURPOSES WE DID NOT PROVIDE OUR DATA POISONING SOURCE CODE
